# TowelsMvc

1) To commence the project, I initiated the creation of an MVC application in Visual Studio, utilizing the Dotnet 3.1 framework. Subsequently, I established an individual account and configured it for secure HTTP (HTTPS). As a precautionary measure, I created a backup by establishing a repository on Github.

2) For the designated topic, towels, I crafted a Model class named "Towels.cs" and incorporated six distinct properties into it. To enhance the functionality of the application, I proceeded to include relevant Nuget packages.

3) Finally, I performed scaffolding operations in the applicationdbcontext to expedite the development process.

4) Then, I made a about us page describing the fictional company, corporate headquarters, staff and general description of the product.
Customized the project to include product images, modification of the default style, present unique colour preferences, even font

5) I proceeded to create an "About Us" page, which provided a comprehensive overview of the fictional company, including its corporate headquarters, staff, and a general description of the product.

6) To enhance the overall appeal and user experience, I implemented customizations that included the incorporation of product images, modification of the default style, and the utilization of unique color preferences and fonts. These elements were tailored to the specific needs and aesthetic requirements of the project to ensure that the end product was visually appealing and user-friendly.
